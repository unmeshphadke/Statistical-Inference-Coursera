This repository has the code and the reports for the project for the Statistical Inference coursera class.
There were two assignments in the project. 
The first was a demonstration of the Law of Large Numbers(LLN) and the Central Limit Theorem(CLT) using the exponential distribution.
In the second assignment hypothesis tests are used to compare dependence of one variable on two other variables.
